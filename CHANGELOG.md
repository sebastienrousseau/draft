# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and versions use a `0.0.x`
series until `0.0.999`.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Multi-provider session engines.** In `auto` mode `draft` now drives the
  first installed token-free coding-agent CLI — Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot,
  Cursor, Amp, Crush, Goose, Grok, or Qwen — through its own logged-in session.
  Force one with `--engine <name>`; override the model with `--model`.
- **Engine fallback chain.** A failed session call advances along the chain and
  finally to Ollama, so a queue works online, offline, or across a change in
  connectivity — each job re-selects its engine independently.
- **`--keep-artifacts`.** A successful run now leaves only the finished article
  in the dated folder; the scratch claim ledger is removed unless this flag is
  set.
- **`--print` headless mode**, `examples/` with three runnable, network-free
  demos, benchmarks for the hot paths, and godoc examples.
- Test coverage raised to **≥95%** of app/library statements, including the
  session backends (faked via the `TestHelperProcess` pattern).
- **Cancellation.** A signal-aware context is threaded through the run; quitting
  the TUI or Ctrl+C in `--print` terminates any in-flight provider subprocess or
  Ollama request instead of orphaning it.
- **Experimental provider gating.** Only `claude` and `copilot` are verified end
  to end and used by auto mode; the rest are marked experimental and require
  `--experimental` (or `--engine <name>`), so the breadth claim stays honest.

### Changed

- DOCX extraction now returns a clear "requires macOS" error off Darwin instead
  of a confusing missing-command failure.
- Removed the unwired surgical-review prompt (`prompt.Review`) and its dead
  helpers rather than shipping unused code.
- Documented the agent auto-approve trust surface in the README security notes.

### Fixed

- **Header no longer bleeds.** The status line is fitted to the terminal width
  and hard-clipped, dropping the tagline then the model/word-range as space
  shrinks.
- **Logo** renders the Kenaz rune with a bright wordmark.
- **Progress bar** shows an explicit percentage.
- **`.golangci.yml`** migrated to the v2 schema; `make lint` runs clean.
- Truncation check decodes the final rune, so a draft ending in a smart quote or
  ellipsis is no longer flagged as truncated.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Initial release: a Bubble Tea CLI that turns research PDFs into grounded,
  body-only Markdown drafts, writing with Claude via the active CLI session when
  online and a local Ollama model when offline, grounded by a verified claim
  ledger.
